### Mehmet Can YaÄŸmurkaya
#### Software Developer

I graduated from Computer Engineering program. I'm interested in web programming, but I also like to work on data science. I know it's two different technologies, but I'm still developing projects in two areas and trying to learn new things. I write articles about the topics I research and the technologies I learn and share them here.

Skills: NodeJS, React, JavaScript, Python, SQL, MongoDB, Redis
